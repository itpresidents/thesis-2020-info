# Presentation Workflow

1. Everyone should keep their **webcam turned on** to be respectful of everyone in the room. 
2. Your resident will mute everyone in the Zoom room. 
3. When it’s your turn to present, click **Share Screen**. Your resident will do this if you want them to play your pre-recorded video.
	- **Select the window of your presentation program.** *Do NOT* select your entire desktop. You do not want your reviewers to see a messy desktop, nor any icons, or pop-up notifications.
	- IMPORTANT! If your presentation has audio or video
		- Check **Share computer sound**
		- Check **Optimize Screen Share for Video Clip**
4. Unmute yourself, and **say, "Ready,” to ensure that everyone can hear you.**
5. **Your resident will say**, “I’m going to start the recording. After you hear, ‘This meeting is being recorded,’ you can start presenting.” (Resident, hit that record button!)
6. For presenting:
	- If you are presenting live, you can begin.
	- If your presentation is a pre-recorded video, introduce yourself and your project before playing your video.
	- If you want your resident to play your pre-recorded video, introduce yourself and your project first, and your resident will hit play.
7. Your resident will record your presentation and feedback so you can review it again before Thesis Week.
