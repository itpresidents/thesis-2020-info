# General Presenting Tips

- [] **Be energetic and upbeat**, at least 20% more than if you were in person. Your passion and enthusiasm WILL transfer through the screen.
- [] **Speak slowly** and clearly. Presenters often talk faster than they realize during presentations.
- [] Try to **look directly into the camera** to make “eye contact” with your reviewers. I know this seems unnatural and weird, but it will be the opposite experience for your reviewers.
- [] Your viewers will see your slides/video to the left of your webcam, so **gesture to the right**.
- [] **Describe your images and videos on your slides** for those with low vision or blindness. Such as, “The image on this slide shows the user using my prototype..." or "The video I'm about to play shows my fabrication process, including laser cutting, 3D printing, and wood-working.")
- [] It is recommended to caption videos. YouTube does a good job of automating this, but then you’d have to stream your video from YouTube and over Zoom. Too many streams. You can manually add captions in Premiere or other video editing software. Here are NYU’s [captioning tips](https://nyu.service-now.com/servicelink/kb_search.do?id=KB0017759).
- [] **Pay attention to your audio levels**, including your mic. Check that levels are consistent across different videos and adjust accordingly. Lower the volume if you plan on talking over your video(s).
- [] **Try not to fidget or move around** in your seat while you’re presenting, such as moving back and forth or swiveling in your chair. It will be distracting for your reviewers.
- [] Make sure your **background is professional**. See How to Look Your Best on a Webcam.
- [] **Practice your presentation** and time yourself!
