# Presentation Checklist

Setup your camera so you're looking at it

If you're going to gesture, gesture to the right.

Use a separate device for presentation notes:
- write it on note cards
- print it out
- use your phone
- setup an external monitor

Check your mic levels.

Pay attention to your audio levels!
- Check levels consistent across different videos and adjust accordingly
- Lower volume if you plan on talking over your video(s)
