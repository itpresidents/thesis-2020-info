# Bandwidth Considerations

## Thinking Ahead

Consider using a wired connection, as your internet speeds are generally faster and more stable via a wired ethernet.

Ask your family & friends who share your internet bandwidth to not use it when you are presenting.

Turn off any devices that auto-upload. Your upload speeds are important so backing up photos to iCloud should probably wait.

## Zoom Requirements

Make sure your computer and internet connection are sufficient for presenting live. Luckily, sharing in Zoom is not that bandwidth heavy.

According to Zoom, sharing video requires a **1.5 Mbps uplink**.
