# Frequently Asked Questions

**My internet is unstable. What should I do?**

Checkout our [Bandwidth Guide](/docs/thesis-presentations/bandwidth-considerations) to better understand your limitations. Practice & test! If you still anticipate you will have internet issues, consider pre-recording a video for your residents to play for you.

**What's the contingency plan if I freeze or cut out?**

It's the fun part of doing it live! I'm kidding. Depending on the issue, we will reschedule you to present later or help you record a pre-recorded video.

**Should I do a pre-recorded video?**

You and your project will connect more strongly with your audience if you present your project live. This is the recommended option. The main reason to show a video would be if you have an unstable internet connection, or you are in a different time zone and cannot be present during your presentation time. 

**Will my presentation be available to view later?**

Yes - we will be uploading recordings to a central location, typically Vimeo, where it can be viewed indefinitely.

**Can I upload a higher resolution video?**

Yes - if you aren't happy with the quality of recording from Thesis Week, you can choose to upload a higher quality video. *This is NOT the video that will be played during Thesis Week.*

**Can I invite non-itp people to view my presentation?**

For Thesis Week, you can invite friends and family to view the presentation by giving them a link to the webinar or the live broadcast.

**I wish there was an option to stream video that wasn't over Zoom**

We do too but the residents are also a bit limited. There wasn't really a great solution that could satisfy everyone and so we opted to keep Thesis Week as a "live event" as it is by tradition. And to make up for it we're letting you choose to upload higher quality video afterwards to Vimeo(?), where Thesis Week recordings normally get uploaded for all of eternity.

**What format will the Thesis Week recordings be?**

TBD. There'll be a broadcast pipeline that should give us better quality than Zoom's Cloud Recording.

**Can I get fancy?**

Of course, be as ITP as you want to be. We like and recommend OBS and can support you a bit there.
