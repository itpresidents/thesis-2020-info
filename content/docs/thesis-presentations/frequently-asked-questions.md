# Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I do a pre-recorded video?**

You and your project will connect more strongly with your audience if you present your project live. This is the recommended option. The main reason to show a video would be if you have media that's super high resolution, or you are in a different time zone and cannot be present during your presentation time. 

**Will my presentation be available to view later?**

Yes - we will be uploading recordings to a central location where it can be viewed indefinitely.

**Can I invite non-itp people to view my presentation?**

For thesis week, you can invite friends and family to view the presentation by giving them a link to the webinar.  They will join as webinar attendees.
