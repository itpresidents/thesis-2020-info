# Tips for Presenting

## Practice Practice Practice!

The more you practice your presentation the better you will be at speaking when it comes time to present.  Additionally, you will discover ahead of time difficulties in your setup and how to resolve them so that when it is time to present live, your setup time will be fast and presentation will be as smooth as possible.

## Make sure your video camera is turned on, and your audio is enabled:

If your zoom toolbar has the below icons (Join Audio and Start Video), your audio and video camera **are not** connected to zoom:

![Join Audio icon and Start Video Icon are Showing in Zoom](https://i.imgur.com/nFuyvzC.png)
*If your toolbar looks like the above, you are not sharing audio or video*


Your zoom toolbar **should look like the below,** with a microphone that pulses when you speak, and video camera icon that is not crossed out.

## Reduce your Screen Resolution for Better Video Streaming

One of the challenges with streaming video from your computer with Zoom will be bandwidth limitations that often results in the video being choppy.   To optimize the quality of the video stream and reduce choppiness, it is **strongly recommeded you reduce your screen resolution.**  We found in our tests that smaller resolutions result in better streaming quality.  This is likely due to the fact that with a higher resolution, more pixels need to be streamed, so reducing the resolution means less pixels and more frames can be streamed. 

**It is recommended your screen resolution is set to 720p (1280x720) or lower for sharing a video**.  The same goes for if you are doing a live presentation, and **your presentation features videos.**

1. Click the apple icon on the top left and go to system preferences

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Should I do a pre-recorded video?**

You and your project will connect more strongly with your audience if you present your project live. This is the recommended option. The main reason to show a video would be if you have media that's super high resolution, or you are in a different time zone and cannot be present during your presentation time. 

**Will my presentation be available to view later?**

Yes - we will be uploading recordings to a central location where it can be viewed indefinitely.

**Can I invite non-itp people to view my presentation?**

For thesis week, you can invite friends and family to view the presentation by giving them a link to the webinar.  They will join as webinar attendees.
