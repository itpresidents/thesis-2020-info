# Presentation Guide for Students

You will be presenting your thesis both during [Final Presentations]({{< relref "#may-5-final-presentations" >}}), on May 5th, and [Thesis Week](#may-12-15-thesis-week-presentations), on May 12-15.

## Instructions for Presenting

### Instructions for Sharing Live Presentation

If your are showing a live presentation, you will be doing so via Zoom's screen share option.

1. If your presentation features video, and you want to minimize choppiness for viewers of the video, [reduce your display resolution.](#Reduce-your-Screen-Resolution-for-Better-Video-Streaming)
2. [Make sure your video camera is turned on, and your audio is enabled](#Make-sure-your-video-camera-is-turned-on-and-your-audio-is-enabled)

If your presentation has audio or a video, **make sure to check the boxes 'Share computer sound'**

**Update: Don't use 'Optimize for full-screen video clip' unless you've tested it** beforehand. We've found that this feature doesn't work as well as lowering your screen resolution.

It is recommended you **share the window of the presentation program,** and not the whole desktop, so that viewers dont see your icons or any notifications that pop up:

# Tips for Presenting

## Practice Practice Practice!

The more you practice your presentation the better you will be at speaking when it comes time to present.  Additionally, you will discover ahead of time difficulties in your setup and how to resolve them so that when it is time to present live, your setup time will be fast and presentation will be as smooth as possible.

## Make sure your video camera is turned on, and your audio is enabled:

If your zoom toolbar has the below icons (Join Audio and Start Video), your audio and video camera **are not** connected to zoom:

*If your toolbar looks like the above, you are not sharing audio or video*


Your zoom toolbar **should look like the below,** with a microphone that pulses when you speak, and video camera icon that is not crossed out.

## Reduce your Screen Resolution for Better Video Streaming

One of the challenges with streaming video from your computer with Zoom will be bandwidth limitations that often results in the video being choppy.   To optimize the quality of the video stream and reduce choppiness, it is **strongly recommeded you reduce your screen resolution.**  We found in our tests that smaller resolutions result in better streaming quality.  This is likely due to the fact that with a higher resolution, more pixels need to be streamed, so reducing the resolution means less pixels and more frames can be streamed. 

**It is recommended your screen resolution is set to ~720p (1280x720) for sharing a video**.  The same goes for if you are doing a live presentation, and **your presentation features videos.**
