# Viewer Guide

Zoom is complex, highly personalizable software. This is a quick guide to being a good citizen for ITP thesis presentations.

1. When someone is presenting, **adjust your view settings to "Side-by-side Mode"**. This is the best view to see both the presenter and the presentation the way we intended, mimicking our traditional thesis setup.
	- From the top menu, select "View Options" -> "Side-by-side Mode"

2. Keep your **webcam turned on** to be respectful of everyone in the room.
3. Keep yourself muted while someone else is presenting.
