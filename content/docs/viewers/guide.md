# Viewer Guide

This is a quick guide to being a good citizen for ITP thesis presentations.

1. When someone is presenting, **adjust your view settings to "Side-by-side Mode"**. This is the best view to see both the presenter and the presentation the way we intended, mimicking our traditional thesis setup.
	- From the top menu, select "View Options" -> "Side-by-side Mode"

2. Keep your **webcam turned on** to be respectful of everyone in the room.
3. Use your **real name** and preferably a real photo in your Zoom profile.
4. Keep yourself **muted** while someone else is presenting.
